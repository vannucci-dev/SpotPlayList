# Jamming

This project was created to showcase the use of React components, API calls and state management.
I've followed the guidelines and used the styling provided by CodeCademy to realise this web-app.

## Functionalities

The purpose of this app is to create, throught the use of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API, an app that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## Please note

The access token and client ID for the request to the Spotify API had been removed from the repository as sensitive information.
If you want to test the APP, please sign up to Spotify developers and request a client-id to insert in Spotify.js
