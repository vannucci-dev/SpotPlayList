# Jamming

This project was created to showcase the use of React components, API calls and state management.
I've followed the guidelines and used the styling provided by CodeCademy to realise this web-app.

## Functionalities

The purpose of this app is to create, throught the use of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API, an app that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.
